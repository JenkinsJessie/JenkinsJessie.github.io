Hello, my name is Jessie Jenkins and welcome to my portfolio.

I am an aspiring web developer and current student at Champlain College. 
I am a husband and father of 3. 
I am an avid outdoorsman that enjoys backpacking, kayaking, fishing, among many other activities.
Most importantly I am a future employee that can help bring positivity, motivation, loyalty, and of course coding skills to your place of business.  
I like to focus on the task at hand and when finished, enjoy the pride in our accomplishment. 
Feel free to reach out @ jenkins.jessied@gmail.com. I would love to hear from you.
